# timerJS
Responsive timer made in JavaScript.

I used setInerval and clearInterval to manipulate the start, pause and clear state.
If you click on start button the timer will be initiated, if you click on pause button the timer will be paused and clear button is to clear the counter and return to 00:00:00.

You can use it on mobile or descktop enviroment.
I used media query on CSS to make it properly useful on portrait ambient.

Tecnologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
